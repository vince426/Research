This is a part of my undergraduate research. 
Predicting rice prices in NCR using LSTM model

Rice prices are extracted from PSA
Weather variables are acquired from PAGASA
Fuel prices are from Department of Energy
and decided to include a dummy variable on Rice Import Policy (0 - no existing rice import policy; 1 - there's an existing rice import policy)
